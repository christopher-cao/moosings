These past few months have me in a bit of a slump. More than anything, I get this overwhelming sense of *smallness*. And in my motivation slump, I've been thinking about what makes work worth doing. What makes work "important"? How should one approach doing important work?

I think we've all experienced not being able to focus on one thing because there's always something more important to be worked on. In this sense, the desire to do important work becomes its own executioner - perfection the enemy of good. What is the *best* thing I can work on for the betterment of `X`? Fill `X` in with the object of your choice - yourself, your family, community, company, society. We scrutinize our every action under this lens of "objective" importance.

What I'm slowly learning though is that this approach of "most important work" is hugely counterproductive. The funny thing about important work is that the agents of important work often do not understand the significance of their work at the moment of inception. And I'm lucky to have stumbled across examples about how this manifests in fields ranging from cooking to computer science.

## In Cooking

In its guide to creating new culinary techniques [1], [El Bulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bulli?oldformat=true)  (ranked multiple times as the best restaurant in the world) discusses how it can take time to understand the significance of a new technique. Seemingly mundane new techniques only reveal their importance much further into the future, such as after the introduction of a new ingredient or when used in conjunction with other techniques.

Then in his journal [2], Rene Redzepi (head chef at [Noma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noma_(restaurant)?oldformat=true), another restaurant formerly ranked best in the world) discusses this phenomenon in action. In preparation for winter one year, he dried spices in order to use them as flavoring agents. It wasn't until he made a trip to Japan more than a year later that he understood the significance of that drying technique. Inspired by his exposure to matcha, he realized that drying a spice also opens doors to grinding it into a powder and reconstituting it.

> The woodruff powder was a great discovery. Before, we'd only ever seen the dried herb merely as a good way to flavour the cooking liquid for beetroot. Now, as a powder, it was something in its own right - a small mental shift with large consequences. (*A Work in Progress*, 15)

He was then able to create new recipes after realizing the significance of something he had unwittingly done over a year in the past.

The cool thing is that this same situation seems to occur in the sciences as well.

## In Computer Science

I love this passage from Richard Hamming's *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering* [3]. In it, he talks about how the author of a book put something super important and paradigm-shifting into the appendix like it was an after thought. He just can't comprehend how the author didn't grasp the magnitude of what they considered to be ancillary work.

> I had reviewed for a journal the EDSAC book on programming, and there in Appendix D, was a peculiar program written to get a large program into a small storage. It was an *interpreter*. But if it was in Appendix D, did they see the importance? I doubt it!... Yes, they wrote one, and used it, but did they understand the generality of interpreters and compilers? I believe not. (*The Art of Doing Science and Engineering*, 50)

I find this absolutely fascinating. The author had done something so critical in writing possibly one of the first [interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)?oldformat=true), yet it was only an afterthought for them (*very very* much an afterthought at that given they considered whatever was in Appendices A, B, and C to be more important). They had created this interpreter just as a tool to help them achieve a different goal - one that funnily enough they probably considered was more objectively important at the time.

> History tends to be charitable in this manner. It gives credit for understanding what something means when we first do it. (*The Art of Doing Science and Engineering*, 50)

When we look back at historical actions, we tend to ascribe intention to them. We read that someone did important work, therefore we believe *they must have intended* to do important work. We assume a linear intention. In this way, we are "charitable."

But like the examples above show, this isn't always the case. I get the impression that much of the time, agents of historically important work didn't necessarily set out with that intention in mind. **Rather, they set out to do work, *some of which might happened to become important***.

## The Approach

While seemingly obvious to the point of "well no shit," I find this a super important distinction to make. One that is extremely empowering and validating. In fact, for me, it basically defines a new approach to meaningful work.

Let's take the example of "Appendix D." In drawing form, this might be what the author set out to do. Note the **perceived** boundary of objective importance.

Then they wrote their book. Based on how they structured the book, we can guess that they might've considered their work to fall into the diagram like so:

![idk](/images/important_work/pic2.png)

But time revealed a misalignment between the author's perceived objective importance and the reality. Appendix D outshined everything else in terms of objective importance.

![idk](/images/important_work/pic3.png)

The same thing applies to us.

![idk](/images/important_work/pic4.png)

The truth is, we actually know very little about the boundaries of objective importance.

![idk](/images/important_work/pic5.png)

So what do we do in the face of all this uncertainty? What should I possibly work on if I don't know for certain what's *most* important to work on?

We focus on work we **can** do. Work we find **intrinsically important**.

![idk](/images/important_work/pic6.png)

As time goes by, you continue working. You continue creating, contributing, giving. You do challenging things for the sake of doing challenging things. And you grow.

![idk](/images/important_work/pic7.png)

With hindsight and perspective, you eventually start uncovering the true boundaries of objective importance. And, newsflash, it looks pretty different from how you originally imagined it.

![idk](/images/important_work/pic8.png)

Imagine if you took the initial approach and shoehorned all of your efforts into that perceived overlap. Would you have grown as much? Learned as much? Experienced as much? Maybe. Maybe not.

## So what?

So what does this all mean in practice?  

For me, it means putting less credence in my inner critic. The practice of ruthlessly filtering the work I do based on this lens of extrinsic importance is the best way to discourage myself from doing anything. Even if my end goal is to do something of "objective" importance, the best path towards achieving that is to focus on intrinsic importance. Create what I like shamelessly. Work on what I care about shamelessly. The best path to "objective" importance is to simply **do**.

I know that most of this is pretty common knowledge, but I found that exploring it from this angle helped give me back some motivation. At the same time, I'm wondering if I'm just trying to rationalize feeling small. Am I just making excuses for myself to not work on more important issues? Would love to hear your thoughts.
