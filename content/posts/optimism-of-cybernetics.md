Hello friends! Going to try rebooting my Moosings now that Hot Girl Summer is officially on the way! 

I've been reading [*The Dream Machine*](https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119/ref=pd_sbs_1?pd_rd_w=xPY87&pf_rd_p=651d64d1-3c73-45b6-ae09-e545600e3a22&pf_rd_r=M18728DVCZHSEGQHTJPT&pd_rd_r=9c834bab-749e-4ea3-8f57-fdc893b856b9&pd_rd_wg=xTpyq&pd_rd_i=1732265119&psc=1), an exposé on the history of computation with a focus on the work of J. C. R. Licklider, a psychologist whose visionary dream of human-computer symbiosis led to the development of the personal computer. Something I love about the book is that it not only focuses on Licklider's extensive contributions to computing and the development of the Internet, but also on the work of his contemporaries were working and how they influenced his thinking. Entire chapters are spent exploring the evolution and influence of computing-adjacent intellectual movements of the early 20th century, including Skinner's behaviorism, Shannon's information theory, and Von Neumann architecture.

One of the most surprising aspects of the account so far is how much cross-pollination there was between these computing pioneers. The book reads like a testament to the idea that great work [never happens alone](https://www.quora.com/Information-Theory-What-relationship-did-Claude-Shannon-have-with-Alan-Turing/answer/Jimmy-Soni), nor [in a vacuum](https://www.asc-cybernetics.org/foundations/history/MacyPeople.htm).

I want to share about one of the intellectual movements explored in the book called [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics). Simply put, cybernetics frames the world in terms of systems and their goals. It focuses on how anything (digital, mechanical, or biological) processes information, reacts to information, and changes in order to better accomplish its goals – the study of feedback loops. I view cybernetics as the study of how systems cope with change. How does a system detect change? How does it react to the change? How does it **know** to react in that way?  

Cybernetics finds its roots in neurobiology and found practical application during World War II in the development of automated antiaircraft defense. [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener), considered to be the founder of cybernetics, was tasked with the design of antiaircraft guns that could be fully programmed to stay on target. 

Wiener's core insight came during his observations of the behavior of these antiaircraft guns. Sensors and feedback mechanisms were installed so the gun could follow the trajectory of enemy aircraft. If the feedback mechanism for a given gun was too strong, it would over-oscillate and miss. Too weak and it wouldn't oscillate enough. 

He noticed that a gun's following an aircraft was reminiscent of a person's following an object in order to grab it. By extension, he reasoned that if his guns could have poorly calibrated feedback mechanisms, the human nervous system could too. 

In *[Men, Machines, and the World About](https://www.robertspahr.com/teaching/hnm/wiener_men_machines_and_the_world_about.pdf)*, Wiener shares his line of questioning that guided this leap in reasoning. 

> Is there any nervous disease known in which a person trying to accomplish a task starts swinging wider and wider, and is unable to finish it? For example, I reach for my cigar. I suppose the ordinary way I control my action is so as to reduce the amount by which the cigar has not yet been picked up. Is that disease of **excessive oscillation** known?

After confirming with a physiologist, Dr. Arturo Rosenblueth, he discovered his intuition was correct.

> The answer was most definitely that this disease is known. It has exactly the symptoms named. It occurs in the pathology of the cerebellum, the little brain. It is known as the purpose tremor or cerebellar tremor. 

Wiener and his colleagues had stumbled on a significant insight - if it was possible to think of machines in biological terms, perhaps it was also possible to think of **the nervous system in engineering terms**. Up to this point, many scholars believed the brain to be a black box beyond the realm of true understanding.

But with added pressure from nascent cybernetic thinking, cracks started to form in that belief. The brain could be understood as a system. They were on the precipice of a new mentality: the mind and brain are just highly sophisticated information processors. 

This realization that the brain could be understood in terms of how it interacts with information and feedback absolutely electrified people. If even the seemingly opaque human brain could be understood as a system, what else could? The world was cybernetics' oyster. Cybernetics and systems thinking enabled vastly different disciplines to communicate with each other using a common language – a lingua franca of the sciences. 

> In such a universalizing theory, shared conceptual models would force a reconsideration of disciplinary perspectives, as Gordon Pask argued, when cybernetics, 'considers economy not as an economist, biology not as a biologist, engines not as an engineer. In each case its theme remains the same, namely how systems regulate themselves, reproduce themselves, evolve, and learn.'

Soon enough, they realized that the party wasn't limited to the hard sciences. Cybernetics had implications in the humanities and social sciences, as anthropologist [Margaret Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead) elaborates on below: 

> "We ought to look very seriously at the current state of American society within which we hope to be able to develop these very sophisticated ways of **handling systems** that are, indeed, in dire need of attention. Problems of metropolitan areas, ... The interrelations between different levels of government, the redistribution of income..." 

[The Macy Conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences), specifically organized to prompt discussion about cybernetics, brought together professionals and academics from a melange of backgrounds: physicists, mathematicians, electrical engineers, physiologists, neurologists, experimental psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, and cultural anthropologists. Given that cybernetics holds at its core the belief that everything is deeply intertwined, it's no wonder it held such wide appeal.

> From the point of view of cybernetics, the world is an organism," Wiener declared in his autobiography. "In such a world, knowledge is in its essence the process of knowing. Knowledge is an aspect of life which must be interpreted while we are living, if it is to be interpreted at all. 

Out from these conferences came ideas often credited with spawning the birth of AI, cognitive science, complex systems theory, and design thinking among others. They also found application in [many other already existing fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics#Subdivisions_of_the_field).

More importantly, I believe cybernetics' value-add goes beyond its formal teachings about feedback and information. Viewed through a spiritual lens, cybernetics offers an optimistic view on the human condition. 

> Cybernetics held out a vision of humans as neither gods nor clay but rather "machines" of the new kind, embodying purpose – and thus, autonomy. No, we were not the absolute masters of our universe; we lived in a world that was complex, confusing, and largely uncontrollable. __But neither were we helpless__. We were embedded in our world, in constant communication with our environment and one another... Life is the **continual interplay** between the individual and her environment rather than a way of existing under the form of eternity.

In a world where it feels unforgivable to be anything but perfect, cybernetics reminds us with a hopeful message: to be alive is to receive feedback. To be human is to be amenable.

Now after all of this digging into cybernetics, I find myself even more fascinated. Here are some things I'm more curious about: 

 - I find the birth of cybernetics to be particularly interesting. It's a well-studied phenomenon that [analogical reasoning is conducive to creativity](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150773#:~:text=Analogical%20reasoning%20is%20a%20good,the%20pieces%20of%20an%20analogy). The reflexive "if we can think of a machine in terms of biology, then we can also think of biology in terms of machinery" was so ground breaking for its time. What other analogies in the present day are just lying underneath the surface waiting to break new ground? 
 - I strongly believe creativity is highly dependent on inputs (i.e. creativity is not an innate process that you have or don't have - by changing the inputs to your creative process you can "engineer" creativity). Creativity is dependent on the information that the mind receives from the environment. How can cybernetics inform our pursuit of creative work and the tools we use in creative work? Also, just as we can improve the effectiveness of machines by improving their feedback mechanisms, how can we actively improve our own feedback mechanisms to our creative processes? 
 - Cybernetics' focus on feedback mechanisms and optimization immediately made me think of machine learning. Yet we don't hear much about cybernetics today in the context of ML/AI. Why is that? Did cybernetics simply fall out of fashion? What was the role of cybernetics in shaping contemporary approaches to artificial intelligence?

Most of what I've learned about cybernetics is around the history of the field and not the actual mechanics. Hopefully I can learn more by reading Wiener's *[The Human Use of Human Beings](https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/06/15/the-human-use-of-human-beings-norbert-wiener/)*, [*Thinking In Systems*](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557) (which has been sitting on my nightstand for literal months), and exploring this [Are.Na board](https://www.are.na/morgan-sutherland/cybernetics). 



Thanks for reading this brain dump! Until the next. 



Love,
