Hi friends,

Thank you for agreeing to be my beta testers. This isn’t gonna be anything special, but I just want to start getting in the habit of sharing things I find interesting and enriching with people I care about. I’m still not sure where I want to go with this exactly, but I’ll start with sharing just one article that I found interesting over the week as well as some thoughts about the article. My thoughts are going to be relatively rough as I get a handle on things. My main goal this week is to just get the ball rolling.

That being said, the first article I want to share is from one of my favorite blogs, Brain Pickings. I’ve been following Brain Pickings for a few years now. It’s where I go when I a little dose of mindfulness. For when I need a pick-me-up when I’m feeling drained, jaded, and cynical. Maria Popova, the author of the site, just has a special way of highlighting beauty and finding gratitude in even the simplest things.

The article is titled *[Joan Didion on Keeping a Notebook](https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/19/joan-didion-on-keeping-a-notebook/)*. As you might’ve guessed, it’s about keeping notebooks. But more importantly, it’s about why we keep notebooks and why we feel compelled to record our lives whether that be through writing or social media or our cameras.

I’ve kept a pretty regular journal for about four years now, and I think this essay summarizes a lot about why I find the act of journaling so rewarding. The experience of being able to look back and see a time capsule of yourself - of your emotions and thoughts, your deepest worries and concerns, your biggest victories and triumphs - is unlike any other. As you look back with the benefit of hindsight, you get to see how some events that felt earth-shattering in the moment actually ended up being a lot more inconsequential than you had initially thought. How some seemingly insignificant and run-of-the-mill encounters or happenings may have completely altered your life’s direction. In this way, a journal acts as a reminder that things almost never end up the way we envision them. It’s a window to all of our past selves (or as the nerdy part of me would call it, a dimensional reduction of said past selves). I like playing around with the idea that these selves that wrote these journal entries are all different people from the person I am now.  They all had different priorities, social circles, values even. I think staying acquainted with the people whom we used to be - whom we may have outgrown, whom we might miss, whom we might even resent a bit - is an important exercise in mindfulness. A journal is a reminder that you used to be all of these different people. And also a reminder of all the people you have yet to become.

I just want to share a passage from the essay that also captures why I love journaling so much. It’s Joan Didion’s primary reason for keeping a notebook:

> [To] remember what it was to be me: that is always the point… We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were.

I can’t express how much I love this quote. How succinctly it captures how rewarding the act of journaling is.

What does it mean to “remember what it was to be me”? One of my favorite things to do, when I’m feeling particularly lost or cynical, is open up to a random page in a past journal. Sometimes I like what I see - doing well on an exam I studied for, exploring a new city, going to therapy for the first time. Other times I don’t - what it felt like to be heartbroken for the first time, to be a lost senior unhappy with my major. But no matter what, it helps me remember how far I’ve come and that I’m still moving forward.  

And with that, I’ll end with this quote:

> It is a good idea, then, to keep in touch, and I suppose that keeping in touch is what notebooks are all about. And we are all on our own when it comes to keeping those lines open to ourselves: your notebook will never help me, nor mine you.

Thanks for reading :)

Chris
