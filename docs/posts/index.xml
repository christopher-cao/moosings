      <description>I recently came across a concept called &amp;lsquo;working with the garage door up&amp;rsquo; in Andy Matuschak&amp;rsquo;s working notes. It feels pretty familiar, this idea of creating accountability through social pressure like with Instagram fitness challenges and 100 days of code.
Something I particularly liked about Andy&amp;rsquo;s take on it though is his emphasis on how it&amp;rsquo;s a form of creative communication. In his words,
 It&amp;rsquo;s giving a lecture about the problems you&amp;rsquo;re pondering in the shower.</description>

      <description>These past few months have me in a bit of a slump. More than anything, I get this overwhelming sense of smallness. And in my motivation slump, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about what makes work worth doing. What makes work &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo;? How should one approach doing important work?
I think we&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced not being able to focus on one thing because there&amp;rsquo;s always something more important to be worked on. In this sense, the desire to do important work becomes its own executioner - perfection the enemy of good.</description>
