      <p>I recently came across a concept called &lsquo;working with the garage door up&rsquo; in Andy Matuschak&rsquo;s <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu">working notes</a>. It feels pretty familiar, this idea of creating accountability through social pressure like with Instagram fitness challenges and <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">100 days of code</a>.</p>
<p>Something I particularly liked about Andy&rsquo;s take on it though is his emphasis on how it&rsquo;s a form of creative communication. In his words,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s giving a lecture about the problems you&rsquo;re pondering in the shower. It&rsquo;s thinking out loud about the ways in which your project doesn&rsquo;t work at all. It&rsquo;s so much of Twitch. I want to see the process. I want to see you trim the artichoke. I want to see you choose the color palette.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s the emphasis on sharing the <strong>process</strong>. There&rsquo;s so much to be learned in observing the mundane. In just getting to be a fly on the wall and observing someone at work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to reduce a creative process down to discrete key moments and landmarks. A recipe could be reduced to 1) slice the vegetables, 2) prepare the sauce, 3) mix together and roast. It&rsquo;s easy to glaze over the connective tissue, the fibers that hold everything together. The reality is that creative processes are continuous machines, not just snapshots of key moments. It&rsquo;s not just about slicing the vegetables or trimming the artichoke, it&rsquo;s about the way you hold the knife, the way you organize the work bench, how the ingredients are stored. There are so many details to be unveiled just by attentively watching someone operate. You have the main landmark – the skill, technique, or step – but you also have the adjacent structures behind the scenes that support it. They&rsquo;re the infrastructure, not the sexy main attraction. They&rsquo;re the plumbing and the electrical lining and the insulation, not the architectural masterpiece. I recently read an interview with an accomplished animator [1] who was inspired by his mentor&rsquo;s attention to crafstmanship, even the way he held his pencil. It&rsquo;s these kinds of mundane yet essential things that are only revealed when you have that opportunity to watch someone work with the garage door up.</p>
<p>The difference between watching someone in the process vs. listening to them talk about their process is like the difference between reading their diary vs. reading their memoir. With the memoir, you get a boiled down version of the events written retrospectively. Even if the author writes with the intention of conveying their perspective at those moments in the past, they have the benefit of hindsight. By writing about the past in the present, they lose full context around their decisions at the moment. It&rsquo;s easy for some things to stick out much more than others after the fact. On the other hand, the diary is raw and much richer in context. It&rsquo;s as if you get to see in real time the different inputs that went into their decisions. In a way, you could argue that the diary is more participatory – it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re learning with them. You get to see all of their different dead ends, the shortcuts they took, how they derived their processes – not just what stuck out to them after the fact. In this way, their revealing of their entire process is a guidance of sorts. They&rsquo;re providing some raw data points that you then pull together into a cohesive picture. As opposed to being spoonfed, &ldquo;when you see this, you should do this,&rdquo; independently mining the raw data and extracting your own value helps you generate more custom mental models. You get to decide for yourself what makes sense <em>to you</em> and what doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s the very act of making these decisions, of <em>earning</em> the knowledge [2] that helps it stick.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not to say that if we want to learn how to roast an artichoke, we should watch a 2 hour livestream of someone demonstrating it step by step. Or that we need to stress the details about how we set up our counter or hold the knife. But what I am emphaiszing is that there&rsquo;s value to be gained from learning from both condensed sources and the raw material. I kind of imagine different learning techniques to fall somewhere on this pyramid of &ldquo;effort needed,&rdquo; almost like degrees of refinement. The lower you go, the more raw the knowledge source.</p>
<p><img src="/images/knowledge_refinement_pyramid.png" alt="knowledge_refinement"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to focus closer at the top, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the perfect tutorial? The perfect recipe? The perfect course?&rdquo; But we forget that watching and learning is valuable as well.</p>
<p>More practically, I&rsquo;m thinking about how I want to integrate this into my life in order to learn more effectively. I want to find and learn from other examples of working with the garage door open in areas like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sxywu">data visualization</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWRJKe7K0LE&amp;list=PLIHculvWp71pZbB2EoKHzFlreq-LTnr6t">jazz improvisation</a>. I also want to hold myself to sharing not only sharing the end-products of my work, but also what&rsquo;s happening behind the garage door.</p>
<p>Some other examples that came to mind when thinking about this concept are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistolary_novel">Epistolary works</a> like Rene Redzepi&rsquo;s <em>A Work in Progress</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbwUoBeqEqhw9KBZZen8ZnI7bnCCS_imY">Jazz piano streams</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as7Gkm7Y7h4">Walking through a math puzzle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>[1] <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2016-08-31/interview-kyoto-animation-taichi-ishidate/.102999">Interview with Taichi Ishidate</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Would you say you&rsquo;re still learning about the craft, even as you&rsquo;ve become an accomplished director?</p>
<p>A: I have been working as an animator for 13 or 14 years, but, while my ability as an animator has not been decreasing, I feel it&rsquo;s getting harder to see my growth clearly at the same speed as I did before. So if I give up learning about the craft, we can&rsquo;t create entertaining animation. Animation is a part of the entertainment industry, which means I need to not only keep up with advancements in the craft of animation, I also need to keep thinking about what sort of animation we should create to satisfy the audience&rsquo;s ever-changing preferences, rather than just chasing the fashions.</p>
<p>I mentioned before my master was Kigami-san. The reason I think that way is because regardless of his thirty-year career in animation, <strong>he&rsquo;s still wondering if he&rsquo;s holding the pencil the best way.</strong> The way he holds the pencil! Looking at his attitude makes me feel that I have a long way to go. In that sense, I have to work harder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[2] I&rsquo;m reminded of Craik and Lockhart&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/levelsofprocessing.html">&lsquo;Levels of Processing&rsquo; model of memory</a>, where the &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; something is processed when encoded into memory, the easier it is to recall.</p>
